###B1: Navigation and Animation
#### Notes ####
Move the camera with WASD and E to raise, Q to lower.

#### Status ####

##### Part 1 #####
Complete.

##### Part 2 #####
Currently, I imported the mecanim data and went through some of the animation controller documentation (http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimatorControllers.html). All we need to do is wire together the animations to create walk, run, and jump animations. However, I'm stuck on the jump animation. The code I added for the character is in the root asset directory, named AIAgentLocomotion.cs, and the animation controller is AIAgentLocomotion.controller. The scene with the character is in Scenes/scene2.unity

Here's what's left:
- Jump animation and code integration
- Camera following
- Make character a prefab
- Deploy
