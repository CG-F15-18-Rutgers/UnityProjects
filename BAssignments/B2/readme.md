======================= A love story ==========================

We implemented the following new affordances:
- Enlarge - Scales up a character's size.
- Squat - Shows a user squatting down and up.
- Quote - Displays a quote on the screen.
- SetCamera - Switches the camera view.
- ShowAct - Displays information about the current "act".

We also implemented two affordances with the IK library:
- Punch - Interpolates a person's hand to another targets face.
- BecomeCrab - Moves the center of body down to put the person
in the proper "Crab" form.

The fire can be moved with the arrow keys.

Our story has a beginning (the fight), a middle (the workout),
and an end (the choosing of a new Crab God).

The workout behavior changes on each run since the order is
randomized.

Our behavior can be applied to any number of characters.

We implemented a control node If-Then-Else, which is
used to determine which person reaches the fire first 
and becomes the new Crab God.
